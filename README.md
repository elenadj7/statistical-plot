# R Graph Plotter

Welcome to R Graph Plotter, a program that reads statistical data from a CSV file, transforms it into a plot, and saves the result as an image. 
You can customize the file paths for saving the image, the CSV file, as well as the labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the graph title.

## Installation

1. Download and install the R programming language from the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elenadj7/statistical-plot.git
cd statistical-plot
```

## Data Format

Ensure your CSV file is formatted with ',' (comma) as the column separator. The first column should represent the x-axis, and the second column should represent the y-axis.

Example CSV format:
```bash
 .
 .
1,10
2,20
3,30
4,40
 .
 .
```
